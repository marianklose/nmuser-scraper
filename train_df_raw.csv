We are pleased to invite you to the upcoming second *Educational
Pharmacometrics Summer Symposium *(EPSS), which will be held on *27 June
2023*, at the *University of A Coruña*, close to PAGE venue. This one-day
symposium will bring together experts and professionals in the field of
pharmacometrics (PMx) to give an overview of *what PMx is* and *how it can
contribute to model-informed drug development and therapy individualisation*
(programme
<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TEX-cvnhsUj2bmmgLvKdJ_Bef86eGloo/view?usp=share_link>
).



In short, the symposium will begin with a brief introduction to PMx,
followed by a discussion on the use of PMx in drug development, covering
preclinical and clinical applications, and also give an introduction to
mechanistic models. After lunch and networking, the use of PMx to optimise
and personalise treatment will be presented, followed by PMx case studies,
which will be based on submitted student abstracts. The symposium will
conclude with a short group work session. With speakers from academia,
pharmaceutical industry and consultancy, this event covers a broad range of
PMx roles and may also be a great opportunity for those looking for the
next step in their career development.



The symposium is *intended for* students from all natural sciences (Master
and PhD), postdocs, and others with an interest in pharmacometrics, such
as, clinical pharmacists, clinicians, mathematicians, statisticians, or
colleagues from industry.



Students or postdocs/trainees may *apply to present their original
PMx-related work* as a part of the symposium (submitted abstract should not

4737,"Thu, 19 Sep 2013 12:39:23 -0700",[NMusers] Parameter Estimation in IF Conditioning Statement,"Dear NONMEM users,

My goal was to add a drug effect to a disease progression model in a way that 
the drug effect is different when a certain threshold concentration is exceeded 
(similarly to modeling a 'hockey-stick' when performing covariate analysis). 
First, I did it in the following way (partial simplified code)

$PRED

THRESH = THETA(1) ;threshold concentration

INT = THETA(2)+ ETA(1)

IF(WCMIN.LE.THRESH) SLOPE = THETA(3)+THETA(4)*CONC+ETA(2)
IF(WCMIN.GT.THRESH) SLOPE = THETA(3)+THETA(5)*CONC+ETA(2)

IPRED=INT+SLOPE*TIME

and NONMEM did not manage to estimate THRESH=THETA(1) (i.e., the initial 
estimate did not change during minimization and the gradient was zero 
throughout). I tried this for several different initial estimates.

I then centered the observed CONC on THRESH and run the following model because 
colleagues mentioned that they have successfully run a 'hockey-stick' 
estimating the threshold parameter  (partial simplified code)

IF(WCMIN.LE.THRESH) SLOPE = THETA(3)+THETA(4)*(CONC-THRESH)+ETA(2)
IF(WCMIN.GT.THRESH) SLOPE = THETA(3)+THETA(5)*(CONC- THRESH)+ETA(2)

This time, NONMEM provided very reasonable estimates for all model parameters 
and the covariance step was successful.

I wonder now if the centering of the variable (and hence something particular 
to the data set) caused the difference in estimability of the threshold 
parameter or whether NONMEN cannot estimate parameters that only occur in the 
conditioning part of the IF statement (Note that after centering THRESH also 
appears in another part of the code).

Could somebody please provide some insight on this? I have searched in the 
NONMEM user group but could not find anything.

*Overview*
Reproducibility is a cornerstone of QSP and pharmacometric analyses. These
analyses rely on an array of tools such as R (with packages), NONMEM,
gfortran,
PsN and on a given operating system (OS). Over time these tools and the OS
are
updated for compatibility reasons, bug fixing and introducing new features.
Some of these updates can however alter the results or even break the code
of
previous analyses, and as such reproducibility fades over time. Changes in
tools’ version can also be a challenge for reproducibility across different
computing environments.

IQdesktop (https://iqdesktop.intiquan.com) is a freely available
pharmacometric
computational environment which comes fully qualified and pre-installed
with
most pharmacometric and QSP tools such as MONOLIX, NONMEM, PsN, xpose, R
and a
CRAN snapshot (some tools require their own private licenses). Each
IQdesktop
image version contains a unique snapshot of the OS and tools’ version.
IQdesktop relies on the latest virtualization and containerization
techniques,
allowing to easily install, scale and deploy different versions of the
images
on any host computer system.

This webinar will address the following points:
- Introduction to the concept of computational reproducibility
- Introduction to containerization and IQdesktop
- Live Demo of IQdesktop
- Installation walkthrough
- Q&A session

""We were discussing the usefulness of nonmem error messages: what to do 
if $COV failed, or even if estimation step has not converged 
successfully (e.e., infinite OF message).


Nick point is that we just ignore the error messages.
My point is that we erro messages prompt us to study the model because 
more often than not, error messages point out to real problem (although 
sometimes they need to be ignored if you are happy with the model).""


Nick replied:

My point is not ""ignore the error messages"". It is ""Do not use the 
termination messages as a guide to whether the model is good or bad.""


(Note that NONMEM does not list them as ERROR messages. They are simply 
messages about NONMEM's view of the world when it decided to finish the 
estimation step. Some messages can be ignored (ROUNDING ERRORS) while 
others (EXCEEDED NUMBER OF FUNCTION EVALUATIONS) probably mean you 
should restart the model where it finished and keep going. Other 
messages in NMVI about boundary conditions are usually just a nuisance 
but if you did happen to be asleep and do not look at your parameter 
estimates then this is a reminder to wake up.


Leonid suggests we use these messages to examine the model. But there is 
no clue in these messages as to which part of the model (or the data) 
should be examined. So they are worthless except to remind you that you 
should be thinking about your model and data.


But you MUST think about the model and the data ALWAYS! It makes no 
difference what termination message you get you must continue to think 
(the hard part <grin>) and remember the advice of Box:


""All models are wrong but some are useful"".

NONMEM has no idea if your model is wrong. It is always wrong but it 
seems Leonid is mislead into thinking it is not wrong when NONMEM says 
MINIMIZATION SUCCESSFUL.
NONMEM especially has no idea if your model is useful. Only you and your 
colleagues who want to use the results of the modelling can decide if 
its useful. Usefulness can be investigated by model evaluation 
procedures (e.g. VPC, NPDE, etc) but the final decision will rest with a 
human brain not NONMEM's randomly generated minimization messages.

Leonid,
  I agree with your point that failure to converge/and or covariance 
is a message that the model is a prompt to study the model.  I object 
to those who claim that model that fails covariance is not useful 
despite data to the contrary (just went around and around with a 
sponsor about this - actually their stats consultant who basically 
just kept insisting on the theory regardless of data that we presented 
to the contrary).  But, I think that the messages are completely 
non-specific - they tell you something is less than ideal, but give no 
clue as to what. I suspect that graphics are likely to be much more 
consistently informative, telling you not only that something is less 
than ideal, but some clue what to do to fix it.  As such, I'm not sure 
that convergence and covariance messages add anything to the process 
(anything that a good and thorough analyst would have known already, 
based on VPC, NPC, various post hoc plots etc).

    (e.e., infinite OF message).

    Nick point is that we just ignore the error messages.
    My point is that we erro messages prompt us to study the model
    because more
    often than not, error messages point out to real problem (although
    sometimes they need to be ignored if you are happy with the
    model). What is
    your opinion?

    Thanks

    al,<br><br> I'm a little confused by this discussion. To make an
    analogy, assume that drug company A has a wonderful theory that
    drug B will
    treat a disease. Theory makes sense by your favorite epistemology
    criteria
    etc. But of course, being good scientists, we know that theories
    must be
    verified, so we do an experiment, and the data suggest that the
    theory is
    wrong. Most of us would criticize as unscientific someone who who
    discarded the data (didn't point out flaws in the data, didn't provide
    opposing data, simply discounted it) in favor of continuing to
    believe the
    theory.<br> Why do we not apply the same standards here? Theory says
    that models that do not converge (or fail covariance) are ""bad"". Data
    (that so far as I know no one has found to be flawed, nor provided
    opposing
    data) suggests that, by at least one criteria (same parameter
    estimates,
    same SD of parameter estimates) there are no important differences. I
    don't disagree that failing a covariance step, or failing to converge
    provide information about a model. But it doesn't seem to be
    informative
    about what we probably really care about -does the line go through the
    points, how confident are we WRT the precision of the parameters
    and is the
    model predictive.<br> I'm not sure if the small number of published
    examples (of bootstrap with ~500 samples) are a small number of
    anecdotes
    or a small number of trials with N ~ 500, but I've run 5 or so
    myself and
    found the same to be consistently the case. That is, a successful
    covariance step is not informative WRT the parameter values or their
    precision. I suspect others have similar experience. If there are
    other
    ""studies""/anecdotes with different conclusions, someone should publish
    them. Otherwise, it seems like we are obligated to abandon this

    I do not support extreme views (from places where people walk upside
    down<br>
    :) ) that Nonmem error messages should be ignored: they serve the
    useful<br>
    purpose to alert when Nonmem is having some difficulties, and should
    always<br>
    be part of the picture. If the data looks good, model is simple,
    then we<br>
    need to look for the reason for the poor convergence. Sometimes it
    helps
    to<br>
    use SIGDIG= 5 or 6 to get 3 significant digits precision. But if
    you are<br>
    working on the limit of the algorithms (as implemented) abilities:<br>
    nonlinear model + stiff differential equations + large range of doses
    and<br>
    concentrations, etc., then you face the situation when you cannot
    force<br>
    convergence even if you try hard. On my recent project, none of
    the<br>
    intermediate model converged even though bootstrap provided pretty
    narrow<br>
    CI (so it does not look like over-parametrized model), all diagnostic
    plots<br>
    were good, and the visual predictive check was reasonable. Then
    you just<br>
    blame the algorithm and move on. You loose the ability to justify
    your<br>
    covariate selection based on the objective function drop (which is
    not a<br>
    good idea any way), and may need to provide a little bit more
    detailed<br>
    investigation to convince reviewers (regulatory and/or journal)

    <br>
    Colleagues,<br>
    <br>
    I am curious as to your thoughts about a particular NONMEM issue.
    I <br>
    often find myself in a situation where a complex model does not <br>
    converge to 3 digits (""no of digits: unreportable"") yet the
    objective <br>
    function is markedly better than a previous model and graphics
    suggest <br>
    that the model is quite good (and better than the previous one).
    Nick <br>
    Holford has advocated (and I agree) that NONMEM's SE's have
    minimal <br>
    utility and the inability to calculate them is not important. <br>
    However, I have not seen similar discussion about whether one can
    / <br>
    should accept a model that did not converge.<br>
    <br>
    The particular situation that I dealing with at the moment is that
    a <br>
    dataset that I am analyzing yielded a series of results that did
    not <br>
    converge as I added parameters (despite an improving fit and a
    marked <br>
    decrease in the objective function), then yet a more complicated
    model <br>
    yielded 3.0 significant digits. In this case, there is no problem
    (I <br>
    can use this final model for bootstrap, VPC, etc.) but what if
    none of <br>
    these models had converged.<br>

where where covN(PEi,PEi) is the covariance of the prediction errors i and i while E is the expectation  of the enclosed _expression_; g and h are partial derivatives of the vector of PK parameters with respect to the ç and å respectively, m is the number of etas in the model etc.)

IWRES = IRES/W

High Throughput Screening and Real World Biomarkers to Predict Drug-Drug and 
Drug-Nutrient Interactions:
Implications to polypharmacy associated with COVID treatment

Individuals with serious COVID infections often have pre-existing 
co-morbidities and are generally older.  Thus, in addition to being prescribed 
drugs for the treatment of COVID19 and its sequelae, many of these individuals 
are taking a myriad of other drugs.  In this presentation, I will describe a 
screening study of 25 small molecule drugs in clinical trials for COVID19 
against 11 drug transporters, which are targets for clinically relevant 
drug-drug interactions (DDIs).    Our in vitro studies revealed that 20 of the 
25 drugs met the criteria suggested by FDA DDI guidance to consider a clinical 
DDI study.  Further, I will describe the analyses of real world transporter 
biomarkers in data from electronic health records, which suggested that several 
of the drugs actually do cause transporter-mediated DDIs clinically.  I will 
end with a discussion of the propensity for many anti-microbial drugs to 
perpetrate clinical DDIs and drug-nutrient interactions, and the use of various 
biomarkers for predicting DDIs in pre- and post-marketing settings.",Announcements,

  In response to the recent discussion in this forum about sample size
and power in NONMEM, Next Level Solutions has developed tools for
formal ""power"" assessment in NONMEM using simulation (as described by
Serge Guzy in this discussion).  Essentially, one or more (preferably
more) models will be provided to Next Level Solutions by the sponsor,
along with proposed sampling schemes.  Additional optional information
includes drop out rates, sampling time errors (reported and
unreported), missing sample probability, trial design (cross over,
parallel), LLQ and dosing time inaccuracies (mean and sd).
  Sampling schemes will be generated (with the described random effects)
and NONMEM analysis by bootstrap (with multiple sets of initial
estimates to reduce the problem of local minima).  The generated report
will include:
   -Probability of model convergence
   -Probability of successful covariance step
   -Probability of the absolute value of all off-diagonal elements of
the correlation matrix of estimation being < 0.95.
   -Mean and SEE for all parameters (by bootstrap, not NONMEM estimates
of SEE)
   -Probability of picking up a hierarchical effect (e.g., effect of age
on clearance vs no effect of age on clearance), given the effect size
described by the model(s) and a log likelihood ratio test.

Turnaround time for analysis will depend on the run times for the
models, but typically is a few days to a week - most of which is
computer run time (1000 samples and NONMEM analyses for each sampling
scheme, or twice that if reduced vs full model hypothesis is to be
tested)

Hello -

I was curious if someone from the group could perhaps describe the basis
for deciding whether to use a block (variance and covariance) versus
diagonal (variance only) form of omega. Specifically, what tests if any
can be performed to decide between the two forms and are there certain
situations where one is preferred over the other as I often see only the
diagonal form used. Any help would be much appreciated -

6437,"Wed, 23 Nov 2016 00:44:30 -0800",[NMusers] RE: No TABLE output with 1500 measurements per individual,"Dear NM-Users,

We are trying to model with NONMEM 7.3 (FOCE.I) a dataset containing one 
measurement per minute for 68 individuals, for a total of 1440 measurements per 
individual. The dataset is therefore composed of ~100,000 rows.
After having defined $SIZES adequately (LIM6 statement), the (successful) 
minimization of the algorithm takes few minutes, without any warning or error 
messages.

The problem is that the TABLE output step is nearly impossible to obtain. Even 
with the FIRSTONLY statement, no table can be obtained in a reasonable time 
period.

Trying to limit the table contents to ID & IPRED only does not solve the issue.

We performed some additional tests with MSF files as input. When applying MSF 
to a dataset composed of only ONE individual at a time, the table takes 24 
hours to be generated.
This would therefore take 68 days (if time increases proportionally... ?) to 
obtain PRED & IPRED for all individuals.

When implementing the model in an alternative commercial software, the table is 
output in less than 20 minutes.

A solution would be to use MSF on a reduced dataset i.e., with a (randomly) 
decreased number of measurements per individual, but we want to avoid this.
What other solution do we have ?

Can anyone provide some input on it ?

Dear all

I am attempting to do some covariate modelling, using the scm wizard in 
Pirana. I have seen some results which I wasn't expecting and would be 
grateful if anyone could shed any light on it for me.


Initially, I used a forward inclusion p value of 0.1 and a backward 
elimination p value of 0.05. This resulted in quite a complex 
(implausible) model (we do have a reasonably large dataset), and I 
decided to be more stringent, using p<0.05 for inclusion (and the same 
p>0.05 for elimination at the last step). As a shortcut, I could see 
from the output from the first attempt (with p<0.1) what I expected the 
final model to look like if I were to run it again with p<0.05, ie where 
the process would truncate. Just to double check (and verify that 
nothing would be eliminated at the last step), I re-ran the scm wizard 
with the more stringent p<0.05. And the results are not what I 
expected... Below I have pasted the output for the first few forward 
steps from each attempt. The results are essentially the same up until 
the third step, although we see some small differences in the OFV 
creeping in from the second step. However, at the fourth step, the 
results are completely different. This isn't what I was expecting, based 
on my understanding of the model selection process. Is this a known 
behaviour? Has anyone experienced this problem and/or know why these 
differences might occur? I'd be grateful for any advice.


Many thanks in advance for your help.

Best wishes
Fiona

It will feature four eminent contributors to pharmacometrics: Doctors Sandy
Allerheiligen of Merck, Rick Lalonde of Pfizer, Shif Mariam of Johnson and
Johnson, and Don Stanski of Novartis.  These industry leaders will first
briefly outline how pharmacometrics and modeling services are currently
delivered in their companies.  They then will present ideas and hold a
round-table discussion follows with ideas for the future, discussing new
areas where our discipline can contribute.  

 

This meeting focuses on the present and future of Pharmacometrics.  There is
a reason that this is especially fitting.  This is the first ISoP  event
held since the premature loss of our colleague, friend, and former ISoP

Intensive course: 'Concepts and Applications of Predicting ADME,
Pharmacokinetics and Population Variability' 

17th - 21st May 2010

Princeton, New Jersey, USA

The course is comprised of lectures, delivered by leading experts in each
field of ADME, interspersed with interactive workshops centred around
practical examples demonstrating how in vitro data generated during drug
development can be used to predict:

*       Metabolic drug clearance (CL) 
*       Metabolic drug-drug interactions (DDIs) 
*       Gut first-pass metabolism 
*       Oral drug absorption incorporating food effects and the impact of
dosage form 
*       Effect of transporters and enterohepatic recirculation on kinetics 
*       Drug distribution to different organs 
*       Population variability in drug concentration-time profiles 
*       Variation in kinetics in specific populations (paediatrics, ethnic
groups, various disease populations) 
*       Time-course of drug in plasma that fits observed clinical data
(achieved using fitting modules within physiologically-based
pharmacokinetics (PBPK) models combined with drug specific in vitro
information)

The main emphasis is on using data generated in pre-clinical stages to
understand the kinetic behaviour of drugs in various target populations.
This informs decisions on the conduct and optimal design of clinical studies
with the ultimate aim of improving the quality of submissions for regulatory
approval.

The complete course runs from 17th - 21st May at the Nassau Inn, Princeton,

At the current stage, we are aiming to develop as quickly as possible a

I got a problem when using NONMEM with STS method. My aim is to get
individual parameter estimates. I would like to let NONMEM estimate
individual parameter one subject by one subject. My control stream is
partially listed below, which is edited according to this thread
http://www.cognigencorp.com/nonmem/nmo/topic035.html

*$SUBROUTINES ADVAN1 TRANS2*

*$PK*
*CL = THETA(1) * EXP(ETA(1))*
*V  = THETA(2) * EXP(ETA(2))*
*S1 = V*

*$ERROR*
*IPRED = F*
*    W = F*
*    Y = IPRED*(1+EXP(ETA(3))*EPS(1))*
* IRES = DV-IPRED*
*IWRES = IRES/W*

*$THETA*
*(10,20,30)   ; CL*
*(10,80,100)  ; V*

*$OMEGA*
*100 ; IIV CL*
*100 ; IIV V*
*100 ; IIV SIGMA*

*$SIGMA*
*1 FIXED ; PRO*
*$EST METHOD=1 INTER MAXEVAL=0 NOABORT SIG=3 PRINT=1 POSTHOC*
*$COV*
*$TABLE ID TIME AMT CMT DV PRED IPRED IWRES CL V ETA(1) ETA(2) ETA(3)
ONEHEADER NOPRINT FILE=sdtab101.tab*

The model can run successfully, and I got individual parameter estimates
from output file. I found that for each subject the individual parameter
estimate changed  if I change the initial value of THETA. It seems that
NONMEM regarded the initial value fixed (just like a fixed typical value).
But I expected NONMEM to estimate individual parameters based on individual
data rather than the initial value. Is there anything wrong with the code?
Thanks in advance.

Thank you all for your answers. I have two follow-up questions:



1.       Is it mandatory to use the matrix R as a variance co-variance matrix 
to obtain the FIM? In case we have already used other type of variance 
co-variance matrix, should we rerun the model with matrix R setting?



2.       How critical is the estimation method for the computed SE? In other 
words, is it relevant to compare two powers computed based on two standard 
errors givens by different estimation algorithms?

 For example, if we used FOCE-INTER to minimize our model, could we compare the 
power (based on the Wald test) to results given by PFIM which is based on FO ?



Just for a little bit of background to clarify why we are interested in the 
Wald test.

We are working on the comparison of different methods to compute the 
statistical power of covariate inclusion in popPK models (SSE (gold standard), 
MCMP, PPE , and Wald test). We have also included the Wald test in our 
comparison because it is the fastest method and mostly because it used by 
optimal designs software. Therefore, the evaluation of the accuracy of the 
power derived by this method could facilitate the bridging step between model 
validation and the design of upcoming clinical trials using optimal design 
software.

Thank you in advance.

Cordially.

I want to add a time-varing covariate in my model. For example, blood
pressure or blood flow as covariates. But I am not sure how to do it. I see
some earlier threads to discuss it but they all use complicated methods.

I am wondering if there are any new way  to do it in NM 7.2?  I see in the
user guide that EVID=4 can indicate physiological change. Is this what I
should use?

Thank you very much for any suggestions.

Best regards,

6586,"Thu, 09 Mar 2017 10:25:09 -0800",[NMusers] question about random seed for simulation,"Dear All
I have finished a multiple dose simulation for 600 subjects and want to perform 
a single dose simulation (different sampling time) on the same subjects (same 
ETA as the first simulation).  I used the same seed for the simulation step, it 
turned out the first subject was the same and the rest of the subjects are not 
and I am not sure whether this was due to the fact that the two simulation has 
different number TIME records.  If so, I wonder what is the proper way to set 
the simulation seed so that the ETAs for the second simulation will be 
identical to the first one.

I know that I could output the individual parameter estimate from the first 
simulation and import them into the second one.  But I was thinking if the 
random seed can be synchronized between the two simulation, it could be an 
easier solution.

Your help is very much appreciated!

Thank you very much and best regards!

When generating a VPC for a nonparametric ($NONPARAMETRIC subroutine on) model, 
I get the following error message from NONMEM 7.3.0 (installed on OSX 10.10.5, 
PsN 4.4.8), which doesn't occur with creating a VPC for a ""normal"" parametric 
model.

> “ #TERE:
> 0ERROR IN READING FILE : FILE15/16 USED BY DAT4 “

The control stream that causes this error is just a MAXEVAL=0 to filter the 
original data on IGNORE/ACCEPT and output needed variables defined in the model 
code, so it should not be a difficult task for NONMEM.

Does anyone know what might be the cause of this error?

Sincerely,
Rob
