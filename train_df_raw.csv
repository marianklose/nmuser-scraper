04570,"Wed, 12 Jun 2013 16:50:35 -0700",[NMusers] Workshop on Pharmacometrics,"Dear Colleagues,

 

Registration is open for the third   <http://pharmacometrica.webs.com>
Workshop on Pharmacometrics as a tool for optimizing drug development,
Château de Longcol, La Fouillade (France), October 28-21, 2013,
<http://www.pharmacometrica.webs.com> http://www.pharmacometrica.webs.com

 

The workshop is intended for scientists in the pharmaceutical industry,
regulatory agencies, contract research organizations, and academia who are
expected to implement and apply model-based approach and to deploy
innovative pharmacometrics concepts and strategies for better supporting and
increasing the efficiency of drug development. 

 

A Clinical Trial Simulator developed in R will be used to illustrate the use
of R in  pharmacometrics, the population PK and PK/PD concepts, the
relevance of the inter and intra subject variability and the impact of
covariates on the clinical trial outcomes. As a working example, the
simulator will be used to generate data of a virtual clinical trial in
non-small cell lung cancer. The model will include a semi-mechanistic PK/PD
tumor growth component, the link between PK and adverse events and the link
between tumor growth and survival. The simulated virtual data will then be
used in a population analysis in NONMEM. The R scripts (including the trial
simulator) and the NONMEM control streams used will be distributed to the
participants.

I am trying to build a structural model for an oral drug. I am getting 
extremely large and unreasonable values for vd, eg a billion L, putting an 
upper limit on theta will give a near boundary warning.
 
Does anyone have an idea why this might occur and how to solve it.
 
This is part of the input file:
$SUBROUTINE ADVAN2 TRANS2
$PK
TVCL = THETA(1)
CL = TVCL*EXP(ETA(1))
V = THETA(2)
KA = THETA(3)
S2 = V
 

$THETA (0,10)
$THETA (0,20)
$THETA  2 FIXED

I never use what you call the ""dual error"" model with log-transformed data as I 
do not undertstand all the assumptions that would be implied. You can refine 
your $ERROR block further by incorporating the LOQ. The moxonidine models of 
Mats Karlsson's group (also in their workshop material or their publications) 
show you how it is coded.
 
Sorry, I do not have the time to find them and paste them into this mail.

Hi Joachim, thanks for your suggestions/comments. 
 
When using LTBS I had used a different error model and the error block is shown 
below
$ERROR
IPRED = -5 
IF (F.GT.0) IPRED = LOG(F) ;log transforming predicition
IRES=DV-IPRED
W=1
IWRES=IRES/W ;Uniform Weighting
Y = IPRED + ERR(1)
 
I also performed bootsrap on both LTBS and non-LTBS models and the non-LTBS CI 
were much more tighter and the precision was greater than non-LTBS.
I think the problem plausibly is with the fact that when fitting the 
non-transformed data I have used the proportional + additive model while using 
LTBS the exponential model (which converts to additional model due to LTBS) was 
used. The extra additive component also may be more important in the non-LTBS 
model as for some subjects the concentrations were right on LOQ.
 
I tried the dual error model for LTBS but does not provide a CV%. So I am 
currently running a bootstrap to get the CI when using the dual error model 
with LTBS.

Hi Neil,
 
1. When data are log-transformed the $ERROR block has to change: additive error 
becomes true exponential error which cannot be achieved without 
log-transformation (Nick, correct me if I am wrong).
 
2. Error cannot ""go away"". You claim your structural model (THs) remained 
unchanged. Therefore the ""amount"" of error will remain the same as well. If you 
reduce BSV you may have to ""pay"" for it with increased residual variability.
 
3. Confidence intervals of ETAs based on standard errors produced during the 
covariance step are unreliable (many threads in NMusers). Do bootstrap to 
obtain more reliable C.I..
 
These are my five cents worth of thought in the early morning,
 
Good luck,
 
Joachim

Subject: [NMusers] Linear VS LTBS


Hi, while data fitting using NONMEM on a regular PK data set and its log 
transformed version I made the following observations
 
  - PK parameters (thetas) were generally similar between regular and when 
using LTBS.
-ETA on CL was similar
-ETA on Vc was different between the two runs. 
- Sigma was higher in LTBS (51%) than linear (33%)
 
Now using LTBS, I would have expected to see the ETAs unchanged or actually 
decrease and accordingly I observed that the eta values decreased showing less 
BSV. However the %RSE for ETA on VC changed from 40% (linear) to 350% (LTBS) 
and further the lower 95% CI bound has a negative number for ETA on Vc (-0.087).
 
What would be the explanation behind the above observations regarding increased 
%RSE using LTBS and a negative lower bound for ETA on Vc? Can a negative lower 
bound in ETA be considered as zero?
Also why would the residual vriability increase when using LTBS?
 
Please note that the PK is multiexponential (may be this is responsible).
 
Thanks.
 
Neil
