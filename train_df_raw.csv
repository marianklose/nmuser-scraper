When using $SIM only, the AUC will be estimated based on the simulated
parameter values including the ETA's. With PRED or if you do $SIM+$EST
(without POSTHOC), the AUC will be based on parameters with ETA set to zero.

Subject: [NMusers] AUC Calculation in Simulation with and without EST

 

I have data from PO, IP, and SQ(pump) infusions of this compound that I am
modeling using 2-3 samples per mouse (30 critters worth), and the fits for a
1 cmpt are pretty good.  In order to obtain a smooth plot to compare to the
observed data, I have run N=1 simulations for a single ""subject"" (ID=1)
using the bootstrapped parameters from all animals (each receiving drug via
a single route).

My question for the NMUSERS is this.  When I just use $SIM without $EST, my
AUC calculated by F1*AMT/CL is wildly different than the AUC I obtain by a
quick trapezoidal check of my PRED column in the output file.  When I use
both $SIM and $EST as shown below, the integrated and trapezoidal AUCs
agree.  Why is there a difference? I presume that it is due to the use of a
dummy value of ""1"" for DV throughout my initial data file, but I don't
understand why.  Thanks as always.

appreciated.)  Paul

extensive and sparse sampling from 330 patients with a run time of ~ 4
days.  I know have data from another 200 patients with sparse data.  I have
created the median and 95th PI from the previous model and overlaid the
current data.  The results demonstrate that the new data is well described
by that model.  When the new data is fit with that model, the data does not
support using the model as some parameters were unidentifiable.  I could
conducted an analysis of all the data simultaneously but was interested in
another method. Therefore, I have implemented $PRIOR into the model and
noticed that with each successive increase of the df, the objective
function significantly decreases.  However, the THETA values do not change
much and are different from the prior estimates used.  The only other
things that changed besides the objective function were the estimates and
SE of the covariance terms and the BSV estimate of the peripheral volume of
distribution. These values become more in line with the those observed
previously, and the correlation values between them becomes stronger.  My
question is it justifiable to use such a high df (df=330) based on these
significant decreases of objective function and covariance as the
information from this meta-analysi would be highly informative.

02024,"Fri, 18 Sep 2009 13:14:17 -0700",Re: [NMusers] VPC appropriateness in complex PK,"Hi Dider,
VPC is very good when your data set is homogeneous: same or similar 
dosing, same or similar sampling, same or similar influential covariates 
that results in similar PK or PD predictions. In cases of diverse data 
sets, traditional VPC is more difficult to implement, and it may not be 
useful.


To see the problem, consider VPC (without stratification) for the data 
with two dose groups, 1 and 100 units (with the rest being similar). 
Obviously, all data that exceed 95% CI would come from the high dose, 
and all data below 5th percentile would come from the low dose, and 
overall, VPC plots and stats will not be useful. With two doses, it is 
easy to fix: just stratify by dose. If you have more diverse groups, you 
have to either do VPC by group, or find the way to plot all values in 
one scale. In cases of dose differences and linear kinetics, one can do 
VPC with all values normalized by dose. In nonlinear cases, it is more 
difficult.


SVPC offers the way out of this problem. In this procedure, each 
observation is compared with the distribution of observations at the 
same time point, with the same dosing, and with the same covariate set 
as in the original data. Position of the observation in the distribution 
of simulated values is characterized by the percent of simulated values 
that is above (or below) the observed value. If the model is correct, 
then percentiles should be uniformly distributed in the range of 0 to 
100. This should hold for any PRED value, and dose, any time post-dose etc.


It is important not to combine all observed points together (to study 
overall distribution of the SVPC percentiles): in this case the test in 
not sensitive. SVPC is useful when these percentile values are plotted 
versus time, time post dose, or PRED (but not IPRED or DV !!) values. 
Then, they can be use to see the problems with the model, similar to how 
WRES vs TIME and WRES vs PRED plots are used. The disadvantage is that 
you loose visual part: your percentile versus time profiles should look 
like a square filled with the points rather than like concentration-time 
profiles. Even in this procedure, it make sense to stratify your plots 
by dose, influential covariates, etc. to see whether the plots are 
uniformly good. Dose, covariate, time or PRED dependencies of the SVPC 
plots may indicate some deficiency of the model.


Note that none of these procedures can be used to evaluate the 
concentration or effect controlled trials, or trials with non-random 
drop out. In order to use VPC-based procedures for these cases, you need 
to simulate accordingly: with dosing that depend on simulated values 
(for concentration or effect controlled trials) or with the drop-out 
models.

Dear NMusers:
The Visual predictive check (VPC, 
http://www.page-meeting.org/page/page2005/PAGE2005P105.pdf  , and JPKPD, 
Volume 35, Number 2 / April, 2008) has  been touted as a useful tool for 
assessing the perfomance of population pharmacokinetic models.  However 
I recently came across this abstract from the 2009 PAGE meeting: 
http://www.page-meeting.org/pdf_assets/4050-Standardized%20Visual%20Predictive%20Check%20in%20Model%20Evaluation%20-%20PAGE2009%20submit.pdf
.
This abstract states that situations when VPC is not feasible but a 
""Standardized Visual Predictive Check (SVPC) can be used are as follows:
– Patients received individualized dose or there are a small number of 
patients per dose group and PK or PD is nonlinear, thus observations can 
not be normalized for dose

– There are multiple categorical covariate effects on PK or PD parameters
– Covariate is a continuous variable which made stratification impossible
– Study design and execution varies among individuals, such as adaptive 
design, difference in dosing schedule, dose changes and dosing time 
varies during study, protocol violations
– Different concomitant medicines and food intake among individuals when 
there are drug-drug interactions and food effect on PK


However, the original VPC articles seem to suggest that these are the 
exact situations when the VPC alone is an ideal tool for model 
validation.  Is there any justification for one approach over the 
other?  Has anyone ever seen an SVPC utilized elsewhere, I have found 
nothing.  Are these truly weaknesses of a VPC?

Cheers!

I have a question. I was trying to build a 2-compartment PK model for marijuana

constants K12 and K21 in PK block and it resulted in poor fitting. Then, I 
later changed to CL,V1, V2 , Q and it resulted in proper fitting. I was 
perplexed as to why I couldn't get a proper fit by providing rate constants? I

not) we should use micro constants in PK block to define our model in NONMEM? 
Does anyone has any useful insights into this?

06451,"Mon, 12 Dec 2016 01:44:36 -0800",[NMusers] Different results with ADVAN4 and ADVAN6,"Dear nmusers,
I have a data set which contains single and multiple ascending dose data.
The model development was initially performed on the single dose data.
I initially developed a model using ADVAN4 TRANS 2 (2 compartment linear
model with oral administration) which I later reparameterized into ADVAN6.
I expected to see some minor differences in parameter estimates, OFV etc
due to the change in subroutine but was surprised to see large differences
in both parameter estimates and OFV (+180 points) but also a significant
improvement in overall fit (graphically) while the data was the same. With
the ADVAN4 the model fit was particularly poor to parts of the multiple
dose data, with the ADVAN6 the overall fit to all data was much improved. I
was using NONMEM7.3 for the analysis.

I guess the ADVAN4 model gets stuck in a local minima, but using the final
estimates from the ADVAN6 model does not help. I would be grateful for an
explanation of the reasons why this happens.

I have included the two models below.

05618,"Thu, 18 Jun 2015 07:05:13 -0700",[NMusers] Estimation of Intake Time,"Dear NMusers, 

 

I would like to present you with a problem that some of you might have faced
before. I am currently building a PK model for a drug with once daily oral
administration. The drug has a long half-life and can be taken either in the
morning or at night. Unfortunately due to lack of consistency in the
recording of the administration times by the study team part of the patients
flagged to have taken the medication in the mornings were in fact taking it
at night (i.e. 08:25 corresponds to 20:25 the previous day). At this stage
there is no way of tracking back what the correct intake times were.

 

The data consists of 2 sparse measurements per patient and indeed looking at
individual profiles you can clearly see that some samples are from the
elimination phase, indicating the drug was taken more than 12h prior. I
could correct the dataset based on an empirical judgement backed up by the
visual analysis but I was hoping there would be a more robust way. 

 

Is there any way to put a THETA on the dosage time for those patients to let
NONMEM estimate a corrected administration time?

 

I tried simply adding an extra parameter on the intake time for those
patients (placed the code in $PK):

IF(FLAG_AM.EQ.1) TIME=TIME-THETA(17)

 

But received the following error message:

 

AN ERROR WAS FOUND IN THE CONTROL STATEMENTS.

 AN ERROR WAS FOUND ON LINE  30 AT THE APPROXIMATE POSITION NOTED:

    IF(FLAG_AM.EQ.1) TIME=TIME-THETA(17)

                     X   

 THE CHARACTERS IN ERROR ARE: TIME

236  DATA ITEM MAY NOT BE CHANGED WITH THIS VALUE OF ICALL.

 

 

I would be grateful for some suggestions on how to deal with this issue.

 

Regards, 

 

Andrzej

NONMEM VI 2.0 Bug List
________________________________________________________
nmfe6.bat
 
1.  To prevent an extraneous character in the result file, 
locate in nmfe6.bat the command
 
copy %2 +FMSG %2 
 
and change it to 
 
copy %2 +FMSG /b %2 /b
 
_________________________________________________________
PREDPP
 
1.  There is a PREDPP bug in TRANS6 that affects the calculation of
derivatives when used with 
ADVAN11 or ADVAN12.  Simulations are unaffected. Estimation using a
conditional method will
yield a parameter search and results that are obviously problematic.
Estimation using the FO
method may or may not yield results that are obviously problematic.
 
This bug is also present in all versions starting with NONMEM V 1.0 
 
This bug is not encountered when TRANS6 is used with ADVAN3 or ADVAN4.

 
Fix:
Locate in TRANS6 the line
 
     X  +GG(1,1,1)*(K21*DK31+GG(4,KP,1)*K31))/(K21*K31)
 
and replace with
 
C CHANGED +GG(1,1,1) TO -GG(1,1,1) 6/2008

04371,"Wed, 09 Jan 2013 02:45:54 -0800",[NMusers] Minimisation problem...,"Dear NMusers

 

I am trying to analyse data from a study in which samples were taken from
each subject at 4 different time points (t=0,5,10,14). The problem with the
data is that there are many missing data points and there is considerable
variation between the subjects. 

 

The subjects are in either a control or a test group, and I want to
determine whether there is any difference in the data values between these
groups.

 

Overall, it looks like the data values increase with time, but there is a
suggestion that in the test group the increase is not sustained but returns
to baseline levels by t=14, whereas the control group is either levelled off
or possibly still rising. 

 

I have used a polynomial model to fit the data up to the 3rd power (which I
think is probably too much) and included additive parameters to modify each
of the coefficients from the polynomial model.

 

The problem I have is as follows: 

When I use the FOCE method the ETA terms collapse towards zero. The quality
of the fit looks poor when judged by a plot of DV against individual
predicted values. 

When I use the BAYES method, I get credible ETA values and a much better fit
(i.e., DV vs ipred clusters sensibly around a line of unity).

 

However, I cannot use the OBJV value from the BAYES method to carry out
hypothesis testing. The final reported parameter estimates following the
BAYES method are sensitive to initial starting values and the number of
iterations performed. If I use the parameter values obtained with the BAYES
method I can determine an accurate OBJV for those parameter values using
FOCE with just 1 evaluation. However, if I perform a minimisation with FOCE
starting with those values, the ETA values collapse and the DV vs ipred plot
looks awful again.

 

I hope this makes some sense to someone out there - I'm a bit of a novice at
NONMEM. I realise the data is far from ideal, but it would be great to get
some statistical information about the difference between the two groups. If
anyone had any suggestions I would be grateful. The biological
interpretation of the experiment will change significantly depending on
which way this goes!

 

Thanks

Gavin

02501,"Thu, 29 Apr 2010 10:47:15 -0700",[NMusers] Questions about M3,"Dear NMusers,

I'm seeking inputs/advice on some M3 related questions.  Any comments and 
suggestions would be appreciated.

I have some Phase 1 data on a drug, which I want to model with a M3 
method.  The LLQ is 10 and peak level is about 80 (it's a cytokine and 
can't ask assay people to do a better job).

I'm using NONMEM 7, therefore, can use PHI function directly. 

Below you can see my initial code (Code 1).  I first modeled SIG as a 
separate THETA(5).  The estimated THETA(5) turned out to be 1.14E6. 
Therefore, all the PREDs=0.5 with TYPE==2.  I had to admire NONMEM because 
it makes (LOQ-IPRE)/SIG close to zero and give me a politically golden 
answer (Prob=0.5) on my LLQ data. 

Since SIG represents the variance of F, in my second try, I set SIG=SD*SD 
and modeled log-tranformed data, because I'm using exponential model on 
the ERROR.  The code is following the initial code (Code 2). 

Here's my questions.

1. Is code 2 a theoretically correct approach?  How is SIG generally 
modeled based on your experience?
2. Currently, I only included one BLQ post Tmax.  The rest were ignored 
(MDV=1).  If I include one BLQ timepoint before Tmax, the model won't run. 
 If I include every BLQ time points after Tmax, the model won't run.  Is 
this acceptable? What's the general practice?
3.  What are the diagnostic tools for BLQ from the M3 method?
4. If I model SIG using all the data, and fix it in the subsequent runs, 
which use the same code as Code 1 with SIG fixed, will this be acceptable?

05603,"Thu, 11 Jun 2015 19:32:33 -0700",[NMusers] BAYES Estimation: OBJECTIVE FUNCTION IS INFINITE,"Dear All,

I am using a cascade of the EM estimation methods implemented in Nonmem 7.2
to solve a high-dimension PK/PD problem. The estimation chain is coded as
below:

$EST MET=SAEM INTER NBURN=2000 NITER=1000 PRINT=5 NOABORT NOPRIOR=0
ISAMPLE=10 SIGL=6 CTYPE=3 IACCEPT=0.4 CONSTRAIN=1 SEED=145612 FILE=Saem.ext

$EST MET=IMP INTER NITER=2000 ISAMPLE=1000 PRINT=5 SEED=581987 SIGL=6,
CTYPE=3 MAPITER=0 FILE=Imp.ext

$EST MET=BAYES INTER NBURN=3000 NITER=25000 PRINT=10 NOABORT NOPRIOR=0
FNLETA=0 ISAMPLE_M1=2 ISAMPLE_M2=2 ISAMPLE_M3=2 IACCEPT=0.4 SEED=231457
FILE=Bayes.ext

​The first two estimation methods run successfuly with a convergence, but
when it comes to BAYES, an error message always occurs:

​ OBJECTIVE FUNCTION IS INFINITE. PROBLEM ENDED
1THERE ARE ERROR MESSAGES IN FILE PRDERR

​I put safety brakes in the code to prevent ​0**power or square root of
negative values, but the problem still occured. Setting lower and upper
bound of the initial estimation, but it did not help either.

I am wondering if anyone here encountered this issue previously? It seems
quite strange to me that SAEM and IMP could succeed, but BAYES fails. Could
you please let me know of the possible reasons behind this? Thanks very
much.

Best Regards

We have a dataset with as many dosing (amount and length of infusion) as 
patients. Once the final model was defined, I have performed a vpc. However, 
because the dosing are very different between patients, is it relevant to 
perform vpc or shall we compute npc or ppc?

 

Can somebody explain the basic difference between vpc, npc and ppc and when 
shall we used one or the other?

 

Last point, how to obtain ppc?

 

 

Best regards

Nicolas
